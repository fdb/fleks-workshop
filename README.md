We now see the page without any layout.

Note the similarities!

It's very important to realize that when writing HTML (which you should always do first), your page will look like this! Just plain text in an ugly Times New Roman font, with blue links and very big images. It's only after we apply CSS that our page will look good. So if you're page looks like crap, *you're on the right track!*.

## Exercise 1: Tribute Page
We're going to make a page dedicated to somebody we admire. You can use Wikipedia to get some information about your idol.
We're not going to focus on styling, just on understanding the basic structure of a page, and which tags to use where.
We'll show how to add small bits of styling to make the page look better.
